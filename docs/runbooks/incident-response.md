# DealerScope Incident Response Runbook

**Owner:** DevOps/SRE Team  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-07  
**Classification:** Internal - Operations Manual

## Overview

This document outlines the standardized procedure for responding to security and availability incidents for the DealerScope enterprise platform.

## 1. Incident Severity Classification

### SEV-1 (Critical) - Immediate Response Required
- **Definition:** System-wide outage, major data breach, critical vulnerability under active exploitation
- **Examples:** 
  - Database completely unavailable
  - PII/PHI data breach confirmed
  - Zero-day vulnerability being actively exploited
  - Complete authentication system failure
- **Response Time:** 5 minutes acknowledgment, 15 minutes initial response
- **Escalation:** Immediate C-suite notification required

### SEV-2 (High) - Urgent Response Required  
- **Definition:** Major feature failure, partial data corruption, high-risk vulnerability
- **Examples:**
  - Primary scraping services down (>50% failure rate)
  - API returning 5xx errors >5% of requests
  - Authentication intermittently failing
  - Potential security vulnerability requiring immediate patching
- **Response Time:** 15 minutes acknowledgment, 1 hour initial response
- **Escalation:** Engineering management notification required

### SEV-3 (Medium) - Standard Response
- **Definition:** Minor feature failure, performance degradation, non-critical issues
- **Examples:**
  - Single scraper failing
  - API latency increased by >50% from baseline
  - Non-critical feature unavailable
  - Minor security patches available
- **Response Time:** 1 hour acknowledgment, 4 hours initial response
- **Escalation:** Team lead notification sufficient

## 2. On-Call Protocol & Communication

### Initial Response Chain
1. **Automated Alerting System** â†’ **On-Call Engineer** (via PagerDuty/Opsgenie)
2. **On-Call Engineer** acknowledges alert within SLA timeframe
3. **Incident Commander** (IC) designated based on severity
4. **War Room** established via Slack + video conference

### Key Roles & Responsibilities

#### Incident Commander (IC)
- **Primary Role:** Overall incident coordination and decision making
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Maintain incident timeline
  - Coordinate all response activities
  - Make tactical decisions for service restoration
  - Communicate with leadership and stakeholders
  - Ensure post-incident review is scheduled

#### Communications Lead
- **Primary Role:** Stakeholder communication and transparency
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manage internal team communications
  - Draft customer-facing status updates
  - Coordinate with legal/compliance teams if required
  - Maintain incident status page

#### Technical Lead(s)
- **Primary Role:** Technical investigation and mitigation
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Lead root cause analysis
  - Coordinate technical remediation efforts
  - Make technical architecture decisions
  - Document technical findings and fixes

## 3. SEV-1 Incident Response Procedure

### Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)

- [ ] **Alert Acknowledgment:** On-call engineer acknowledges alert within 5 minutes
- [ ] **Incident Declaration:** IC creates dedicated Slack channel: `#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-{short-description}`
- [ ] **War Room Setup:** Start video conference bridge, share link in incident channel
- [ ] **Team Assembly:** Page relevant engineers:
  - Database Administrator (for data-related incidents)
  - Backend/API Engineers (for service failures)
  - Frontend Engineers (for UI/UX impacts)
  - Security Engineer (for security incidents)
  - DevOps/SRE (for infrastructure issues)

### Phase 2: Assessment & Communication (15-30 minutes)

- [ ] **Impact Assessment:** Technical Lead confirms scope using monitoring dashboards
  - Check Grafana/DataDog dashboards
  - Review error rates, latency, and throughput metrics
  - Assess customer impact and affected user base
- [ ] **Initial Communication:** Communications Lead sends notifications:
  - Internal stakeholder alert (Slack `#general` + email)
  - Customer status page update (if customer-facing impact)
  - Leadership notification (for SEV-1)

### Phase 3: Mitigation & Resolution (30+ minutes)

- [ ] **Immediate Mitigation:** Technical Lead coordinates short-term fixes:
  - **Feature Flags:** Disable affected features to prevent cascading failures
  - **Traffic Routing:** Redirect traffic away from affected services
  - **Rollback:** If recent deployment suspected, initiate immediate rollback
  - **Scaling:** Increase resources if capacity-related issue
- [ ] **Continuous Monitoring:** Track mitigation effectiveness
- [ ] **Regular Updates:** Communications Lead provides updates every 30 minutes
- [ ] **Service Restoration:** Confirm resolution via monitoring and manual testing
- [ ] **All Clear:** IC declares incident resolved when:
  - Root cause identified and mitigated
  - Service metrics return to normal baseline
  - No related alerts firing

### Phase 4: Post-Incident (24-48 hours)

- [ ] **Post-Mortem Scheduling:** IC schedules blameless post-mortem within 24 hours
- [ ] **Documentation:** All findings, timeline, and lessons learned documented
- [ ] **Follow-up Actions:** Track remediation items to prevent recurrence

## 4. Security Incident Specific Procedures

### Data Breach Response (Additional Steps)
- [ ] **Legal Notification:** Immediately notify legal counsel
- [ ] **Compliance Team:** Engage compliance team for regulatory requirements
- [ ] **Evidence Preservation:** Preserve all logs and forensic evidence
- [ ] **Law Enforcement:** Consider law enforcement notification if criminal activity suspected

### External Attack Response
- [ ] **Isolation:** Immediately isolate affected systems
- [ ] **Threat Intelligence:** Check for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- [ ] **Forensics:** Engage forensic specialist if needed
- [ ] **Customer Notification:** Prepare customer communication plan

## 5. Communication Templates

### Internal Alert Template (Slack)
```
ðŸš¨ SEV-{1/2/3} INCIDENT DECLARED ðŸš¨
**Incident:** {Brief description}
**Impact:** {Customer/service impact}
**IC:** @{incident-commander}
**War Room:** {video-link}
**Channel:** #incident-YYYY-MM-DD-{description}
**Next Update:** {timestamp}
```

### Customer Status Page Template
```
**Service Disruption - {Service Name}**

We are currently investigating reports of {issue description}. 
Our engineering team is actively working to resolve this issue.

Status: Investigating
Started: {timestamp}
Next Update: {timestamp + 30min}

We apologize for any inconvenience and will provide updates as 
they become available.
```

## 6. Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Time to Acknowledge | Time to Respond | Leadership Notification |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| SEV-1 | 5 minutes | 15 minutes | CEO, CTO immediately |
| SEV-2 | 15 minutes | 1 hour | VP Engineering within 1 hour |
| SEV-3 | 1 hour | 4 hours | Engineering Manager next business day |
