## 🗄️ Database Operations

### Migration Strategy
```sql
-- Example migration with rollback
BEGIN;

-- Add new column
ALTER TABLE vehicles ADD COLUMN enhanced_score DECIMAL(10,2);

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_vehicles_enhanced_score ON vehicles(enhanced_score);

-- Update existing data
UPDATE vehicles SET enhanced_score = price_score * market_factor WHERE enhanced_score IS NULL;

-- Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles WHERE enhanced_score IS NULL;

COMMIT;
```

### Backup Procedures
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours
- **Retention**: 30 days for daily, 12 months for weekly
- **Verification**: Automated restore testing
- **Cross-Region**: Replicated to 3 regions

### Performance Tuning

// Example monitoring configuration
const monitoringConfig = {
  slo: {
    availability: 99.9,
    responseTime: 1000,
    errorRate: 0.1
  },
  alerts: {
    critical: ['service_down', 'high_error_rate'],
    warning: ['high_latency', 'resource_exhaustion'],
    info: ['deployment_complete', 'backup_success']
  },
  dashboards: [
    'application_health',
    'infrastructure_metrics',
    'business_metrics',
    'security_events'
  ]
};
```
