# DealerScope AI Evaluation Suite

A comprehensive testing framework that evaluates the completeness and functionality of the DealerScope application against multiple AI models and performance criteria.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/run-evaluation.sh

# Run the evaluation suite
./scripts/run-evaluation.sh

# Or run with verbose output
./scripts/run-evaluation.sh --verbose
```

## 🤖 AI Model Integration

The suite can evaluate your application against multiple AI models:

### OpenAI Models
- GPT-5 (flagship model with superior reasoning)
- GPT-5 Mini (fast and efficient)
- GPT-4.1 (reliable results)
- O3 (powerful reasoning model)

### Anthropic Models
- Claude Opus 4 (most capable)
- Claude Sonnet 4 (high performance)
- Claude Haiku 3.5 (fastest responses)

### Perplexity Models
- Llama 3.1 Sonar (with online search)

## 📊 Scoring System

This evaluation stack is legacy and partially synthetic.
Its scores and completeness labels are not authoritative evidence of current
DealerScope production readiness unless each underlying test/harness is first
mapped to verified live surfaces.

The evaluation uses a weighted scoring system:

- **Functionality (30%)** - Core features and user interactions
- **Reliability (25%)** - Error handling and stability
- **Performance (20%)** - Speed and efficiency
- **Security (15%)** - Protection and compliance
- **Completeness (10%)** - Feature coverage and documentation

### Completeness Levels

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 90%+ | Legacy High Score | Legacy scoring only; not authoritative production proof |
| 75-89% | Legacy Medium Score | Legacy scoring only; not authoritative production proof |
| 60-74% | Legacy Functional Score | Legacy scoring only; not authoritative production proof |
| 40-59% | Legacy Basic Score | Legacy scoring only; not authoritative production proof |
| <40% | Legacy Incomplete Score | Legacy scoring only; not authoritative production proof |

## 📁 Report Output

The evaluation generates comprehensive reports in `./evaluation-reports/`:

```

### HTML Report Features
- 📊 Visual scoring dashboard
- 🧪 Detailed test results
- 🔧 Actionable recommendations
- 📈 Performance benchmarks
- 🔒 Security audit results

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `scripts/evaluation-config.json` to customize:

- AI models to test against
- Test criteria and weights
- Performance benchmarks
- Security requirements
- API endpoints to validate

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- DealerScope application running
- Network access for AI model APIs (optional)

## 🚦 Running Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Test only frontend functionality
node scripts/ai-evaluation-suite.js --suite frontend-functionality

# Test only security compliance
node scripts/ai-evaluation-suite.js --suite security-compliance

# Test with specific AI model
node scripts/ai-evaluation-suite.js --model gpt-5-2025-08-07
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Services failed to start"**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check if ports 3000/8000 are available
- Verify backend script exists and is executable

**"Backend not available"**
- Backend script may not be present (frontend-only evaluation will continue)
- Check if Python dependencies are installed for backend
- Verify database connectivity

**"Permission denied"**
- Make script executable: `chmod +x scripts/run-evaluation.sh`
- Check file permissions on evaluation suite

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
./scripts/run-evaluation.sh --verbose

# Check individual components
curl http://localhost:3000  # Frontend
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Backend
```

## 🤝 Contributing

To add new test suites or AI model integrations:

1. Edit `scripts/ai-evaluation-suite.js`
2. Add new test methods to the `AIEvaluationSuite` class
3. Update `evaluation-config.json` with new criteria
4. Run the suite to verify changes
